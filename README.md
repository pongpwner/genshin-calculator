### About

It is a tool to be used for the game Genshin Impact.  It calcualtes how much materials the player needs to reach their goals.

### How to use
Calculators:
Select what you want to calculate on the header.  Then enter the materials you have for the calculator.  The input is colorcoded based on the rarity of the material.  You do not have to fill in every field, just the ones you are interested in.  Then hit the submit button when you are done.  On the right there is a section that tells you what you need.  The calculator converts any extra material you have to the next level of rarity.  It will tell you what you still need, and how much of each material you have left if you were to convert them all.

### What I learned 
Calculators
This is my first project I created using react class componentes and redux.  The Weapon component is a class component where the state is stored in the component. The Character and Talent have their state stored in their respective reducers.  The  I also used the reselect library for selectors to use in mapStateToProps.
I learned to use a folder structure with components, pages, redux, and images all having their own folder.  Each component has its own folder with a stylesheet to go with it.  I also learned how to use react-router to link to different pages on my app.
